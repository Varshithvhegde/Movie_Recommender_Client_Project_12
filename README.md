## Overview
Next up is a movie recommendation system that offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity, genre, and year. 
The model also give personalized recommendations based on the user's choice of genre and cast.
Finally, the system suggests similar movies have a higher probability of being liked based on the movie selected by user.

## Tech Stack and Softwares used
1. `Frontend` : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, BootStrap, jQuery
2. `Backend` : Python flask
3. `Database` : PostgreSQL, SQLite3
4. `ML model` : Jupyter Notebook
5. `IDE` : PyCharm
6. `Version Control` : Git
7. `Deployment` : Heroku

You can also see the list of dependencies in the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file.


## Libraries and Toolkits used
`Python` : NumPy, Pandas, ast (Abstract Syntax Trees), pickle

`ML` : ntlk (Natural Language Toolkit), sklearn (scikit-learn)

`SQLite` : sqlite3, SQLAlchemy


## Recommendation Algorithm
For recommendations of similar movies, a content-based recommendation system. For recommendation, the system takes into account movie titles, genres, starring cast, keywords, overview, and the director. I have implemented Cosine Algorithm after the vectorization of movies. 
It is achieved by using Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) mechanism. Resource for Annoy: https://github.com/spotify/annoy


## Deployment
For Deployment, I have used `Heroku` as a platform.
A deployed version can be checked here: [Next Up](https://next-up-movies.herokuapp.com/)


## Installation/Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository in your local system.
* Open terminal in a new folder and enter the command given below.
   <!-- ```
   git clone https://github.com/kashishahuja2002/Microsoft-Intern-Engage.git
   ``` -->
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kashishahuja2002/Minor-Project-Next-Up.git
   ```

2. Make sure that Python is installed and updated in your machine.

3. Install dependencies.
* Open terminal in the cloned folder and enter the command given below.
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
  
4. Run the project.
* While you are still inside the cloned folder, write the following command in terminal to run the website locally. 
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   
5. If everything is done in order, the app will be running at "http://127.0.0.1:5000"


## CD Setup
For continious deployment, heroku is used. Any changes pushed to the main branch will be automatically deployed. 


## Future Scope
* `Like/Dislike` : The option to like or dislike a movie adds the movie to the user's like/dislike list. As of now, I am just accumulating the data. This can be further extended by using the like/dislike list to recommend movies to the user.

* `Watch Movie` : The watch movie option currently displays the same movie intro for all the movies. In the future, it can be customized according to the movie selected.

* `Collabrative Filtering` : The model currently uses a content-based recommendation system. It can be converted into a hybrid system by adding a collaborative filtering mechanism.
